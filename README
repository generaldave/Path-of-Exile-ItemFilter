Loot filter for Path of Exile: https://www.pathofexile.com/

In my filter, I tried to maintain the original colours of the game, but highlight items that a person would definitely want to pick up. For example Divination Cards that are either worth money or worth completing the set have a border around them that is the same colour as the original Divination Card text.

I did this in two different filters. One is for leveling. It doesn't hide anything, except useless Divination cards. It just highlights things worth picking up. I decided not to hid anything because at low levels, all gears are worth looking at. For instance, when you first start a new league, you'll be wearing white gears, so blue gears are pretty much always upgrades. Here are the notes in the filter file for my leveling version of the filter:

# Updated: 11/10/2016 - Fixed colouring
#
# 1. Quality Flasks - Glassblower's Baubles
# 2. Sulphur Flasks
# 3. Gems with quality have a text colour mathching border.
# 4. Valuable currency (Chaos Orb, Exalted Orb, Eternal Orb, and Mirror
# ---of Kalandra) has a tan border.
# 5. RGB and 6 socket, not 6 linked gear have a currency colored border.
# 6. 6 link items that are not unique have a green border.
# 7. Cards have blue~ish border, same as text.
# 8. Show everything else.

The filter I use for endgame is a lot more involved. It handles flasks as individual classes. It only shows valuable uniques. It breaks down maps into tiers and has text colour appropriately. For example, high tier (Tier 11+) maps which are red on the Atlas have red text.It still highlights currency and Divination Cards the same as the leveling filter. It also shows Chaos recipe and Regal recipe items with yellow and blue borders. The filter then hides everything else that's pretty much useless. I did not include a secion for crafting bases or Chancing bases, as I always find it more profitable to just buy what you want. The notes for my end game filter are as follows:
